            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="about">
                Hi, Aidan Carr here, thank you for taking the time to visit my website and I hope you find 
                the site easy to follow and engaging.
            </p>
            <p class="about"> 
                I was in college when I decided to set up 
                ACE Tours in 2022 to cater for the escorted small group side of the tourism industry here 
                in Ireland. The name ACE Tours stands for Aidan Carr Executive Tours. As consumer confidence returns post pandemic, I spotted a niche in the market as 
                people return to travel but may want to do so privately in smaller groups and not on a coach tour 
                with 40+ people. That is why my company only covers a max of 4 passengers in one vehicle which is usually a Mercedes Viano.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I offer a fleet of modern vehicles and a team of driver-guides who are the best in the business 
                that offer excellent service and make your holiday a unique experience. Some of my drivers have 
                over two decades of experience in the industry so there is no corner of Ireland they cannot take you.  
             </p>
             <p class="about">
                Thank you for your time and I look forward to touring with you soon! 
             </p>
